title: Day 1 - gpt4all - first pass
description: Try out gpt4all with local indexing of MPB coursework
date: "2023-06-08"

This trial was not successful. gpt4all is an open source GPT application you can run locally on you computer, without internet. Something like this will have to be the basis for AI layer for this project, but these initial trials were not successful. 

- [gpt4all repo](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all)  
- [gpt4all docs](https://docs.gpt4all.io/index.html)

This project has been gaining in popularity mostly because you can run it locally on your computer without internet, it is your own private AI. 

For an MPB chat app, this would be hosted by MPB so it can serve the chat AI to users over the internet. Since MPB controls the server, MPB is in control of the privacy of its users.

## Local Docs Plugin

- [Localdocs docs](https://docs.gpt4all.io/gpt4all_chat.html#localdocs-beta-plugin-chat-with-your-data)

One recent addition to gpt4all is their first plugin called local docs. The above linked doc goes into much better detail on this - here's a snippet:

> "LocalDocs is a gpt4all plugin that allows you to chat with your local files and data. It allows you to utilize powerful local LLMs to chat with private data without any data leaving your computer or server... LocalDocs works by maintaining an index of all data in the directory your collection is linked to. This index consists of small chunks of each document that the LLM can receive as additional input when you ask it a question."

As you can see in the screenshot it has access to a folder called MPB which contains both the english and spanish versions of Mi Primer Bitcoin coursework

## Models

  onClick={() => window.open('/day_01_available_models.png', '_blank')}
/>

gpt4all allows you to plugin in the LLM model of your choosing. 

- In this UI there are currently 14 options, but there are many, many more models in the world.

- A side note to understand here is that the censoring that OpenAI does is a layer on top if the model. But that's why you see people hacking their prompts to get around that layer.

## Back to the trial. 

I tried out the simple but important question:

> What are the positive aspects of CBDCs?


### Here are the results of four models:

1. `gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy`

<Image 
  src="/test_cbdc_question/gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.png" 
  width="718" 
  height="404" 
  alt="Image" 
  onClick={() => window.open('/test_cbdc_question/gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.png', '_blank')}
/>

At first thinks I'm asking about CBD. After correcting it, the answer it overall shitty. Also, the citings at the bottom of the page to the actual indexed MPB document are just wrong. I later asked it specific questions about the MPB pdf and the citations didn't line up with the content. More on this later.

2. `gpt4all-l13b-snoozy`

<Image 
  src="/test_cbdc_question/gpt4all-l13b-snoozy.png" 
  width="718" 
  height="404" 
  alt="Image" 
  onClick={() => window.open('/test_cbdc_question/gpt4all-l13b-snoozy.png', '_blank')}
/>

This answer is also bullshit from a bitcoiners perspective, but you can judge for yourself of course.

3. `mpt-7b-chat`

<Image 
  src="/test_cbdc_question/mpt-7b-chat.png" 
  width="718" 
  height="404" 
  alt="Image" 
  onClick={() => window.open('/test_cbdc_question/mpt-7b-chat.png', '_blank')}
/>

> CBDCs can provide several benefits, including:
> 1. Decentralization: CBDCs allow individuals to access financial services without relying on intermediaries such as banks or payment processors. This can increase financial inclusion and reduce the cost of transactions for individuals in remote areas or with limited access to traditional banking services.
> 2. Security: CBDCs are designed to be secure, using advanced cryptographic techniques to protect users' assets from hackers and other threats.
> 3. Flexibility: CDCs can be used for a wide range of transactions, including purchasing goods and services, transferring funds between individuals or businesses, and investing in various assets such as stocks, real estate, or commodities.
> 4. Privacy: Unlike traditional banking systems, CDCs allow users to maintain their financial privacy by using pseudonyms or other forms of anonymity. This can be particularly important for individuals who want to keep their financial transactions confidential.

The first answer cites "decentralization". Not good.

4. `v3-13b-hermes-q5_1`

<Image 
  src="/test_cbdc_question/v3-13b-hermes-q5_1.png" 
  width="718" 
  height="404" 
  alt="Image" 
  onClick={() => window.open('/test_cbdc_question/v3-13b-hermes-q5_1.png', '_blank')}
/>

> The positive aspects of CDCs include:
> 1. Decentralization: CBDCs are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any central authority or bank. This reduces the risk of a single point of failure and increases the security and resilience of the system.
> 2. Lower transaction fees: Since CDCs operate on a distributed ledger technology (DLT), transactions can be processed quickly and at a lower cost compared to traditional banking systems.
> 3. Increased accessibility: CDCs can provide increased access to financial services for individuals and businesses that may not have access to traditional banking systems, particularly in underbaked regions of the world.
> 4. Privacy and security: CDCs use advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure the privacy and security of transactions, making them less susceptible to fraud and cyber attacks.
> 5. Flexibility: CDCs can be used for a wide range of applications, including payments, remittances, and smart contracts, providing flexibility in how they are used.

Once again "Decentralization: CBDCs are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any central authority or bank." 13b-hermes seems to be the rage in open source models judging from the Nomic AI Discord, which is a Discord full of people excited about open sourced AI. These are people looking for an alternative to ChatGPT. I am excited to try this model out for more objective coding questions, but it fails miserably on the CBDC question.

## MPB Specific Questions

I did ask it a number of questions specific to the MPB coursework that it has indexed an available. It gave good enough answers related to the technical aspects of Bitcoin, as it is trained on Bitcoin knowledge in the base model. However, it didn't seem to reference the MPB text well. 

Day #2 might be able to fix this issue though with the Agent technique.

I didn't post these questions and answers here because of flojera. But the gpt4All program is very easy to setup. It's package in a desktop application now. And adding the MPB pdfs to be indexed are very easy as well. You should try for yourself - just see the docs at the top.

## Conclusion

While these initial tests failed miserably with the base CBDC question, an open source and private LLM is the absolute necessary first step. Once again, I'm a novice with AI tech, but a couple possible solutions:

1. Train your own model
2. The agent layer on top of these model that I'll get to in Day #2
3. Something other layer on top of the model
