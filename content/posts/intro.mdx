# Goals

This project has 4 goals:
1. Find an AI base layer that is open source, privacy preserving, and non censoring.

2. Also with the principles of open source, privacy preserving, and non censorship use connecting layers on top of the base AI 
so that individual projects such as Mi Primer Bitcoin, Mastering Lightning, etc, can be indexed so that they can be referenced directly by the AI.
Thus anyone teaching a course on Mi Primer Bitcoin, for example, can build on this base layer for an MPB specific AI powered app.

3. Create an open source project that packages this AI base layer so that it's easy to self-host and has an easy API.

4. Have fun exploring all the new AI tooling coming out, and also prepare and contribute to the fight against AI centralization.
